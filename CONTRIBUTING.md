## Reporting issues

* Describe what you expected to happen.
* If possible, include a minimal, complete, and verifiable example to help us identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
* Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an exception.

## Submitting patches

* All test need to be pass
* All lint need to be green
* Include tests if your patch is supposed to solve a bug, and explain clearly under which circumstances the bug happens. Make sure the test fails without your patch.
